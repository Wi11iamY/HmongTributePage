                <ul>
                    <li><b>4,000-3,000 BCE:</b> Hmong people originated near the Yellow River and Yangtze rivers in China.</li>
                    
                    <li><b>1790-1860:</b> Chinese rulers used military force to suppress the Hmong and other ethnic groups and forcing them into more mountainous 
                        regions like Laos, Burma, Thailand, and Vietnam</li>
                    
                    <li><b>1893-1940:</b> The Hmong people began living in close communities in Laos leading to these provinces to be heavily taxed</li>
                    
                    <li><b>1940-45 (World War II):</b> A division of the Hmong in Laos led to two groups. 
                        Those who stayed loyal to the French and Royal Lao Government, and the Communist Party.</li>
                    
                    <li><b>1947:</b> Those who stayed loyal and assisted the French were officially recognized as citizens of Laos</li>

                    <li><b>1963:</b> Hmong living in Laos were recruited by the CIA sponsored secret operation known as Special Guerrilla Units (SGU) 
                        while some enlisted as Forces Armees du Royaume, the Laotian royal armed forces</li>

                    <li><b>1968-69:</b> 18,000 Hmong soldiers were killed in combat. 
                        By 1969, Hmong troop strength was nearing 40,000. Under the new administration of Pres. Richard Nixon, 
                        U.S. bombing of Laos escalated, and Congress learned of CIA covert military operations in Laos.</li>

                    <li><b>1971-72:</b> By 1971, the Secret War was weighing heavily on the Hmong and the people of Laos. 
                        The estimated death toll for Hmong soldiers this year alone was 3,000, with 6,000 more wounded.</li>

                    <li><b>1973 (February):</b> A cease-fire and political peace treaty was signed in Paris, 
                        requiring the US and all foreign powers to withdraw all military activities from Laos.</li>
                        
                    <li><b>1973:</b> More than 120,000 Hmong became refugees in their own homelands. 
                        18,000 Hmong soldiers were left in Laos, representing nearly three-quarters of the irregular forces. 
                        About 50,000 Hmong civilians had been killed or wounded in the war.</li>

                    <li><b>1975:</b> North Vietnamese Army and Pathet Lao captured Royal Lao positions, and South Vietnam fell to Communist North Vietnam. 
                        Gen. Vang Pao and about 2,500 Hmong military forces and family members were airlifted from Long Cheng air base to Thailand. 
                        As many as 30,000 other Hmong crowded into Long Cheng, hoping for escape.</li>

                    <li><b>End of War: </b>between 30,000 and 40,000 Hmong soldiers had been killed in combat, and between 2,500 and 3,000 were missing in action.</li>

                    <li><b>1975-2015:</b> After overthrowing the Laotian monarchy, the Pathet Lao launched an aggressive campaign to capture or kill Hmong soldiers and families who sided with the CIA.
                        Many fled to Thailand</li>

                    <li><b>2010:</b> census recorded more than 260,000 Hmong in the United States. 
                        More than 66,000 of that number lived in Minnesota, most of them in or near the Twin Cities—the largest urban population of Hmong in America.</li>
                </ul>

            <p><i>“When I die, let me be born Hmong again, so we can all love each other just as we did during my lifetime” (Xiong).</i></p>
